# Simplest Jekyll
> A Github Pages Jekyll site reduced to one page of content and a theme


## Live demo

- [michaelcurrin.github.io/simplest-jekyll/](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/simplest-jekyll/)


## How to use this project

### Setup

1. Click _Use this template_ to create a new repo.
2. Enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in your repo's settings.
3. Check your repo's _environment_ tab to see when the deploy is done.
4. Click _View deployment_ to see the live site.

### Customize

- Edit the `index.md` file with your own content. This is your homepage.
- Update the `README.md` with your own details. This is not actually used in the deployed site.
- Check the docs and tutorials on the [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com/) site.

_Note: On Netlify, the `/` path gives an error and so `/index.html` must be used. I don't have a workaround for this, though my other Jekyll projects work fine on Netlify._
