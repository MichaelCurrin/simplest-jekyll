# My Github Pages user site

This site is very stripped down to miminal content for Github Pages and is not suitable for local develpment - you'll typically add a `.gitignore` for example.

See the [MichaelCurrin/simplest-jekyll](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/simplest-jekyll) repo.

For a more useful template that includes setup instructions and notes throughout, see:
